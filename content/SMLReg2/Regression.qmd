# Challenge Summary

In this session we did not use the recipes packages to prepare our data. This is going to be your challenge. For further information take a look at the last session or just use google. Prepare the data for the models with the steps provided below. Remember, you donâ€™t need to set the flags by yourself (see all_nominal()).

# Libraries

Load the following libraries. 


```{r}
# install.packages("plotly")

library(tidyverse)
library(tidyquant)
library(broom)
library(umap)
library(ggrepel) # Addon for ggplot, so that the labels do not overlap

# Modeling
library(parsnip)

# Preprocessing & Sampling
library(recipes)
library(rsample)

# Modeling Error Metrics
library(yardstick)

# Plotting Decision Trees
library(rpart.plot)
```


# Data

```{r}

# Data set
bike_data_tbl <- readRDS("bike_orderlines.rds")
bike_data_tbl
```



Congratulations! You are done with the 2nd challenge!
